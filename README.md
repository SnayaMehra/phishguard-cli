# PhishGuard CLI

Cybersecurity awareness through automation.

PhishGuard CLI is a phishing detection and risk analysis tool built on Kali Linux using Python.  
It analyzes a given URL and identifies common phishing indicators such as SSL issues, IP-based URLs, domain legitimacy, and basic domain metadata.

This project demonstrates how phishing detection logic can be automated using system-level security tools available in Kali Linux.

## Features

- SSL certificate validation (real-time handshake check)
- Detection of IP-based URLs
- WHOIS domain registration verification
- Domain age extraction from WHOIS data
- Registrar detection
- URL pattern-based anomaly scoring
- Suspicious TLD flagging
- Subdomain abuse detection
- Numeric trick detection (e.g., g00gle-style spoofing)
- Weighted modular risk scoring engine
- Structured CLI output (Ultra Edition mode)

## Enhanced Analysis Modules

- URL length analysis
- Special character density check
- Suspicious TLD identification
- Deep subdomain structure analysis
- Registrar extraction from WHOIS metadata
- SSL validation scoring
- Domain age-based trust modeling
- Transparent risk breakdown summary

The tool provides a final verdict:

- LOW RISK
- MEDIUM RISK
- HIGH RISK

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Anamika0x/phishguard-cli.git
cd phishguard-cli  
```
Install required dependency (Linux-based systems):

sudo apt install whois  

If additional Python modules are required:

pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## Usage

Run the tool:

python3 main.py  

Enter a URL when prompted.

Example:

Enter URL: https://google.com  

The tool will scan the URL and display a calculated risk verdict along with intermediate detection signals.

---

## How It Works

1. Parses the input URL
2. Extracts and normalizes the domain
3. Performs SSL handshake validation
4. Checks for raw IP usage
5. Executes WHOIS lookup via system tool
6. Extracts domain age & registrar
7. Applies URL pattern heuristics
8. Detects numeric substitution tricks
9. Analyzes subdomain structure
10. Calculates weighted risk score
11. Displays structured verdict

The risk score increases if:

- SSL verification fails
- The URL uses a raw IP address
- WHOIS data is missing or domain is unregistered
- Domain age is extremely new
- Suspicious URL patterns are detected
- Excessive subdomains are present
- Numeric character spoofing is detected
